# LastWish.eth - Project Status & Milestone

**Date:** January 2, 2025  
**Status:** Production-Ready MVP  
**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

LastWish.eth is a stateless web application that allows users to create professional, printable PDF documents containing crypto inheritance instructions. The application supports multiple wallets, multiple blockchains, and provides a complete inheritance planning solution.

**Key Principle:** No accounts, no private keys, no seed phrases stored, no persistent data. Everything is client-side except API key hiding and payment verification.
