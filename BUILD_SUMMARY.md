# LastWish.eth - Build Summary & Checkpoint

**Checkpoint Date:** January 4, 2026  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Git Tag:** `v1.0.0-checkpoint`  
**Status:** Production-Ready ✅

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

LastWish.eth is a stateless web application that allows users to create professional, printable PDF documents containing crypto inheritance instructions. The application supports multiple wallets, multiple blockchains, and provides a complete inheritance planning solution.

**Key Principle:** No accounts, no private keys, no seed phrases stored, no persistent data. Everything is client-side except API key hiding and payment verification.

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Multi-wallet connection** (EVM via WalletConnect, Bitcoin via Xverse/Manual)
- ✅ **Asset inventory** from multiple wallets (native tokens, ERC-20, NFTs, BTC including SATs)
- ✅ **Incremental wallet connection** (connect → load assets → connect more → repeat, up to 20 wallets)
- ✅ **Asset selection** with multi-select, grouping, sorting, and filtering
- ✅ **Spam token filtering** (hides dust tokens and suspicious names)
- ✅ **Beneficiary management** (up to 10 beneficiaries with optional contact info)
- ✅ **Asset allocation system** with validation (percentage or amount, NFT vs fungible differentiation)
- ✅ **Over-allocation prevention** (validates totals don't exceed 100% or asset balance)
- ✅ **Inline allocation editing** (edit allocations directly from summary cards)
- ✅ **Auto-reallocation** (redistributes allocations when beneficiaries are removed)
- ✅ **ENS name resolution** for wallet addresses (forward and reverse, supports .eth, .base.eth, .sol, .btc)
- ✅ **Wallet ownership verification** via signature (prevents unauthorized access)
- ✅ **Payment gating** with dynamic pricing ($20.26 special, $42.00 regular)
- ✅ **Discount code system** (private codes for testing/friends)
- ✅ **Client-side PDF generation** with automatic print dialog
- ✅ **Professional PDF document** with title page, table of contents, page numbers

### UI/UX
- ✅ Clean, modern layout with reduced brightness (softer gray tones)
- ✅ Progress indicator with step tracking (free navigation between steps 1-4)
- ✅ Real-time validation and error messages
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile and desktop)
- ✅ Enhanced container sizing (queued wallets, allocation panels)
- ✅ Sortable allocation summary (by name, status, chain, type)
- ✅ Consistent ENS resolution display (green checkmarks for resolved names)
- ✅ Promotional pricing display with animations and emojis

### Security
- ✅ No seed phrases or private keys collected
- ✅ Wallet ownership verification required before asset loading
- ✅ Client-side only (except API routes for Moralis/Blockstream)

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Simplified Wallet Options

- Manual Bitcoin address entry + Xverse support
- Cleaner, less cluttered interface

### PDF Design
- Professional black/gray text-only styling
- No colored boxes (ink-saving)
- Clear section headers and hierarchy
- Page numbers on every page
- Table of contents for navigation

### Address Display
- Full addresses displayed (no truncation)
- ENS resolution with green checkmarks
- Format: "Hex Address" with "Resolves to: ensname.eth" below

---

## 🔄 State Management

### Local Storage
- Payment state (invoiceId, paymentVerified, discountApplied)
- Queued wallet sessions
- Resolved ENS names cache

### Session State
- Connected wallets (Set of addresses)
- Selected assets
- Beneficiaries
- Allocations
- Form data (owner, executor, instructions)

### Payment State Reset
- After PDF download, payment state resets
- Requires new payment for additional downloads
- Ensures each generation requires payment verification

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Considerations

1. **WalletConnect Session Limits**
   - Solution: Auto-disconnect previous session before adding new wallet
   - Max 3-4 active sessions before needing disconnect

2. **Spam Token Filtering**
   - Default threshold: 0.000001
   - Can be toggled off in UI
   - Native tokens and NFTs always shown

3. **ENS Resolution**
   - Supports .eth, .base.eth, and other TLDs
   - May show warning for unresolved names (.sol, .btc)
   - Cached for performance
