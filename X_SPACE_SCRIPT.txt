LASTWISH.ETH - X SPACE TALKING POINTS SCRIPT
================================================================================

OPENING (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey everyone. I want to share a tool that solves a real problem in crypto: what 
happens to your assets if something happens to you? Most people don't have a plan, 
and their families can't access their wallets. LastWish.eth helps you create a 
clear, printable inheritance plan for your crypto assets. It's not a custodian, 
it doesn't hold your keys, and it doesn't execute anything - it just generates 
instructions your family can follow.


THE PROBLEM (1-2 minutes)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the issue: if you pass away, your family may not know:
- Which wallets you used
- What assets you held
- How to access them
- How you wanted them distributed

Traditional estate planning doesn't cover crypto well. Wills often don't include 
wallet addresses, seed phrases, or instructions. LastWish.eth fills that gap by 
creating a document that lists your assets, shows how to access them, and 
specifies how you want them distributed - all in one PDF you can print, notarize, 
and store safely.


HOW IT WORKS (2-3 minutes)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The flow is straightforward:

Step 1: Connect your wallets
- Connect via WalletConnect (MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)
- Or connect Bitcoin wallets like Xverse
- You can connect multiple wallets - up to 20 on the standard plan
- Each wallet requires a signature to verify ownership

Step 2: View your assets
- It pulls your holdings: native tokens, ERC-20s, NFTs, Bitcoin, Ordinals
- You choose which assets to include
- It filters spam tokens automatically

Step 3: Allocate to beneficiaries
- Add beneficiaries with their wallet addresses
- Allocate by percentage or fixed amount
- NFTs can't be split - they go to one person
- Real-time validation prevents over-allocation

Step 4: Add details
- Owner information
- Executor information
- Key access instructions
- Everything needed for your family to execute the plan

Step 5: Generate PDF
- Creates a professional, printable PDF
- Includes all wallet addresses, asset details, allocations
- NFT images are embedded
- Ready to print, notarize, and store securely


SECURITY AND PRIVACY (1-2 minutes)

Important points:

We never touch your keys
- We never ask for seed phrases or private keys
- We use standard wallet connection protocols

COMMON QUESTIONS (1-2 minutes)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Is this legal?
A: It generates instructions, not legal documents. Consult an attorney for your 
   jurisdiction. The PDF is a tool your lawyer can use.

Q: What if I update my holdings?
A: Generate a new PDF. Since we don't store data, each plan is a snapshot.

Q: Can I use this on a public computer?
A: Yes. All data is cleared after PDF generation. Nothing persists.

Q: What if I forget my password?
A: There are no passwords. We don't store accounts. Each session is independent.

Q: Do you have access to my wallets?
A: No. We only read balances via public APIs. We never have access to move funds.
